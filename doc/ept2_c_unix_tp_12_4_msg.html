<h3>3. MSG</h3>

Modifiez de nouveau le programme que vous venez de faire afin de 
séparer dans 2 processus différents les threads s'occupant des 
trains et l'affichage, mais ce coup ci utilisez des queues de messages pour 
transmettre au processus d'affichage les changements de position des trains.

<p>

<b>Attention:</b> un message de type 0 n'est pas valide.

</p><p>

Par exemple, voici le résultat pour les valeurs suivantes:

</p><p>

<table width="600"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#000000"><font class="generic" color="#e2e2e2"><blockquote><tt><pre>
#define NB_TRAINS       7
#define NB_PLACES       3
#define PONT_DEB        3
#define PONT_FIN        5
#define SIZE_TOTAL      9
</pre></tt></blockquote></font></td></tr></tbody></table>
